# Addons for Home Center 2

This repository brings togehter things I have developed for Home Center 2. The bulk of the work has gone into setting up functions for flexible date and time triggers that are functional and based on boolean logic operators rather than nested if/then/else statements.
The focus for me has always been on simplicity of use and robustness, rather than one off solutions. That is why I think many of these devices could be of use for others as well.

There are also some scenes that may help others in using the functions.
